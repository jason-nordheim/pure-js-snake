# Vanilla JavaScript Snake Arcade Game 

A pure HTML/CSS and Vanilla JavaScript version of the classic arcade game: "snake"

## Run it! 

You will need to run a local server if you want to run the project locally. 

1. Clone the repository - In the desired directory, clone the repository: 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/jason-nordheim/pure-js-snake-wds
```

2. Navigate to the project root 
```sh
cd pure-js-snake-wds 
```

> If you do not have `live-server`, you can install it globally (which will make the package available in any directory) via NPM by entering the following command: `npm install -g live-server` 

3. Start the server - the `index.html` should open in your default browser  
```sh
live-server 
```

4. Switch to your browser. When you press any Arrow Key (Up, Down, Left, or Right) the game will start.
